# about bon appétit feed

I am a huge bon appétit fangirl, and when I found out they have RSS feeds, I wanted to make something with them.

I also wanted to get more practice building React apps, and I'd never used XML for a GET request, so I wanted to try my hand at that. 

This little app was made with HTML/JSX, pure CSS and ReactJS. I used [xml-js npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js) to convert the XML from the RSS feed to a JSON object. The app is deployed using Heroku.
